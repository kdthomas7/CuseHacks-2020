## Inspiration
We know that people have trouble sticking to their dietary needs, so we wanted to make life easier for the everyday consumer. Putting power back into the hands of the customer.

## What it does
While the user is doing their shopping, the app allows them to scan the barcode of any item and lets them know if they can eat the product.

## How We built it
We utilized Expo as a mobile application development platform, which is based on React.

## What's next for InfoBytes
Utilizing Googles Cloud Vision API, so that the user could also just take a snapshot of the ingredients list if the barcode is not present or damaged. InfoBytes will also track which items you buy and transfer all this information into a spreadsheet file, where the user can view an organized spreadsheet of their food purchases.
